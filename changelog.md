## 5.0.0 (2023-06-25)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ddf4842dc78389e87615f5c2ddf9e859b11277b2/> `with()` on windows to be able to lookup `program` in registry/PATH.
   The underlying invocation of `with()` changed slightly on windows to make it more useful
   as it can now find application names like `chrome` in the registry, but that change may also
   be breaking for some who previously worked around the previous behaviour.
   
   Please let us know if this truly works better, or if more changes are needed to launch something
   with a program on Windows.
   
   See https://github.com/Byron/open-rs/pull/82 for details.

## 4.0.2 (2023-04-16)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-5f1f80f9fb63e6c63b48ef97370711fd8cebcfcc/> now works within WSL if `gio` is installed.
   `gio` would fail on WSL which is fixed by detecting that WSL is present
   which is when `wslview` will be prioritized.
   
   Note that the binary size inceases by ~13kb as we try to avoid running `wslview`
   first and fail everywhere, so prefer runtime performance on linux over binary
   size. The binary size changes only on unix.

## 4.0.0 (2023-03-10)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9ceb0a4b707022a6ce8046d3512be7c7a51d77a4/> Windows URL encoding for multiple query params
   Previously, passing a URL with multiple query parameters on Windows would result in
   improper escaping, causing unexpected behavior when using it with "cmd /c".
   This commit addresses this issue by properly escaping all query parameters in the URL.
   Now, URLs with multiple query parameters are handled correctly on Windows.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0cd6f98d0a97ac3ddcecefc5d33952e7632298a5/> set minimal required Rust version of 1.62.
   This version is motivated only when compiling on windows (but we can't differentiate that)
   due to the recent addition of `CommandExt::raw_arg()`.
   
   This might be a breaking change as previously there was no minimal supported Rust version.

## 3.4.0 (2023-03-06)

<csr-id-7e2a9c645cd4ff5f86ece7cdc220e18c1b4ac1b5/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-adf99e91af0f1c034123170e6dca77489484b004/> un-deprecate `that_in_background()`.
   In some configurations launchers may block, thus it's better to provide an easy mechanism to unblock
   an otherwise blocking call. This is alongside being able to use `command()` directly and simply spawn
   the command without waiting for it.
 - <csr-id-66e0d7c295317aed27e89af8e323dde3b761c0e3/> `with_command()` to obtain the command that opens a program with a given application.
 - <csr-id-a501d65388562724471b5493fe54c88fe23df31e/> improved error messages that will list the invoked command.
 - <csr-id-245c95ede24adc6694d935993d6045d19a935035/> `commands()` function to obtain a list of launchers to open the given path.
   This allows async applications to control the application launch in an async way,
   for instance with `tokio`.

### Other

 - <csr-id-7e2a9c645cd4ff5f86ece7cdc220e18c1b4ac1b5/> improve documentation around how to use the library.

## 3.3.0 (2023-03-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-fdd2ef013fe7dee1767694e229f4653f16d4ab8a/> add command function to return std::Command
   Adds new `command` function that returns the underlying `std::Command`
   that would be called to open given path.
 - <csr-id-056cb003d19a6deb58214a041ee76d62716524c2/> use std Command
   Use std `Command` instead of `ShellExecuteW` from windows sys crate.
   
   This change was already attempted in: https://github.com/Byron/open-rs/issues/25
   and later reverted in: https://github.com/Byron/open-rs/pull/27
   and it it seems that it didn't work due to incorrect usage of
   `explorer` instead of `cmd /c start`.
   (see https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/5820#issuecomment-1416796024
   for detailed explanation).

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-55dc10dd1b3d04dbb0c7acb2b0a5efe7fc97dee6/> don't unnecessarily reject launchers on linux.
   Previously it probably went through 5 launers assuming they don't work
   before falling back to `xdg-open` which is usually present.
   
   Now it will use the first launcher that it could invoke.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-df358d296fc40801e970654bf2b689577637db5e/> deprecate `that_in_background()` as `that()` is definitely non-blocking now.
   Note that we keep `with_in_background()` as it's unclear if a custom
   launcher blocks or not.

## 3.0.0 (2022-06-12)

A major release which simplifies the error type to resolve a significant problems that surfaced on
linux (and was present from day one).

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0bdc6d64ed425b2627a7ba17614f44ba686536fb/> Assure `that(…)` is non-blocking on linux
   This change goes hand in hand with removing additional information
   from the error case which was the reason for the blocking issue
   on linux.
   
   Note that the top-level `Result` type was also removed.

## v2.0.1 (2021-08-15)

Update documentation. No functionality changes.

## v2.0.0 (2021-07-25)

**Breaking**: Change result from `io::Result<ExitStatus>` to `io::Result<()>`.
Commands that exit with a successful exit status result in `Ok`, otherwise an `Err` variant is created.
Previously it was easy to receive an `Ok(ExitStatus)` but forget to actually check the status. Along with
issues with particular programs reporting success even on error, doing error handling correctly was
close to impossible.
This releases alleviates most of the issues.

## Notes

`wslview` always reports a 0 exit status, even if the path does not exist, which results in false positives.
